KEYBOARD

TELEPORT <PLACE>- e.g TIVO, LIVETV, GUIDE, and NOWPLAYING.

SETCH <CHANNEL> - Change channel. If the current tuner is recording a program, it will change the other tuner. If both tuners are recording, the TiVo will respond with "CH_FAILED RECORDING <Title>. Using this command while Tivo is replaying will give "CH_FAILED NO_LIVE".

FORCECH <CHANNEL> - This command will force the current tuner to the tune the desired channel regardless of what it's doing. If a recording is being recorded it will cancel the recording and change the channel without confirmation.

Also a complete set of IRCODEâ€™s exist

Code:
